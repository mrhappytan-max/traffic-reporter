// THE ONE CANONICAL VERSION SOURCE for this project.
//
// Everything that states a product version must derive from APP_VERSION
// below — GET /version, /admin/deployment-status, PRODUCTION_MANIFEST.json,
// SYSTEM_STATE.json, 00_CURRENT_STATE.md and 06_VERSION_HISTORY.md
// included. Nothing may declare a version of its own.
//
// WHY THIS COMMENT EXISTS (PRODUCTION_VERSION_LINEAGE_RECONCILIATION,
// 2026-08-25)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// This file was last bumped on 2026-08-21 at V1.8.6.9 and then never
// again — while V1.8.7.0 through V1.8.7.14 all shipped to Production.
// For three weeks GET /version told the truth about the deployed COMMIT
// and a two-month-old lie about the deployed VERSION.
//
// The drift was not one mistake. Three different things each believed
// they knew the version, and none of them was this file:
//   - GET /version read APP_VERSION here .................. V1.8.6.9
//   - the Engineering Memory export scraped commit messages
//     for the newest /V\d+\.\d+\.\d+/ it could find ....... V1.8.7.7
//   - ENGINEERING_STATUS.md carried its own hand-written label
// A version scraped from a commit message is a version nobody owns: it
// moves when someone happens to type one, and stalls when they don't.
// scripts/export-meeting-room.mjs now reads THIS constant and treats the
// commit-message scrape as a drift warning only.
//
// THE RULE, PERMANENT: any change that reaches Production and alters
// runtime behaviour bumps APP_VERSION in the same commit. Task names
// (CCTV_METADATA_RECOVERY, PBS_ACCIDENT_CCTV_ENRICHMENT_FIX, ...) are
// engineering labels and NEVER substitute for a version number. There is
// exactly one product version line — never a parallel V1/V2/V57.x series.
//
// Pure docs, governance, Drive-sync tooling and test tidying do NOT bump
// this; they still get a commit.
//
// SCHEME SWITCH (三段式版本治理, 2026-08-25): the four-part V1.8.7.x
// pattern above is RETIRED. V1.8.7.14 was the last four-part version.
// Three-part semantic versioning is now ACTIVE:
//   bug fix                        -> patch   (V1.9.0 -> V1.9.1 -> ...)
//   clear new feature / arch phase -> minor   (V1.9.x -> V1.10.0)
//   large incompatible change      -> major   (-> V2.0.0)
// Do NOT pre-bump this constant for a governance-only round; it moves
// only in the same commit as the runtime change it describes.
//
// V1.9.0 (2026-08-26) — root-cause fix, quad (accident) CCTV prepare-
// timeout observability. A real 國3 96K+700 accident at 09:20 pushed
// LINE text with no image and NO completion log of any kind; the same
// event succeeded fully 10 minutes later with no code change in
// between. Confirmed root cause: cctv/dynamicCollage.js's quad path
// carried no stage tracking at all — unlike the single (dynamic-
// shoulder) path, a quad 'prepare-timeout' never recorded which stage
// was in flight, so a genuine one-time slow external dependency
// (frame fetch, JPEG compose, or R2 publish — all three are proven to
// share the same time budget) was structurally invisible. Fixed by
// giving the quad path the same stageTracker mechanism the single path
// already had, plus per-stage elapsed timing and frame counts on every
// outcome — see test/cctvQuadPrepareForensics.test.js for the full
// forensic writeup and the deterministic reproductions (A-G) that
// prove FRAME_FETCH_MODE=PARALLEL, that a slow candidate can hold up
// compose for the whole quad, and that compose/R2-publish time is
// charged against the same budget as frame-fetch. No retry, no second
// fetch attempt, no budget-number change, no fallback — RETRY_REQUIRED
// = NO for this round; this is pure observability plus the outer
// budget's pre-existing behavior, unchanged.

// Bumped only when the SHAPE of a public/admin JSON response this

// /admin/deployment-status) would need to know about — not on every
// feature round. Currently unchanged since it was first introduced.
