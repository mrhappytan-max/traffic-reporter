// THE ONE CANONICAL VERSION SOURCE for this project.
//
// Everything that states a product version must derive from APP_VERSION
// below — GET /version, /admin/deployment-status, PRODUCTION_MANIFEST.json,
// SYSTEM_STATE.json, 00_CURRENT_STATE.md and 06_VERSION_HISTORY.md
// included. Nothing may declare a version of its own.
//
// WHY THIS COMMENT EXISTS (PRODUCTION_VERSION_LINEAGE_RECONCILIATION,
// 2026-08-25)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// This file was last bumped on 2026-08-21 at V1.8.6.9 and then never
// again — while V1.8.7.0 through V1.8.7.14 all shipped to Production.
// For three weeks GET /version told the truth about the deployed COMMIT
// and a two-month-old lie about the deployed VERSION.
//
// The drift was not one mistake. Three different things each believed
// they knew the version, and none of them was this file:
//   - GET /version read APP_VERSION here .................. V1.8.6.9
//   - the Engineering Memory export scraped commit messages
//     for the newest /V\d+\.\d+\.\d+/ it could find ....... V1.8.7.7
//   - ENGINEERING_STATUS.md carried its own hand-written label
// A version scraped from a commit message is a version nobody owns: it
// moves when someone happens to type one, and stalls when they don't.
// scripts/export-meeting-room.mjs now reads THIS constant and treats the
// commit-message scrape as a drift warning only.
//
// THE RULE, PERMANENT: any change that reaches Production and alters
// runtime behaviour bumps APP_VERSION in the same commit. Task names
// (CCTV_METADATA_RECOVERY, PBS_ACCIDENT_CCTV_ENRICHMENT_FIX, ...) are
// engineering labels and NEVER substitute for a version number. There is
// exactly one product version line, V1.8.7.x — never a parallel V1/V2/
// V57.x series.
//
// Pure docs, governance, Drive-sync tooling and test tidying do NOT bump
// this; they still get a commit.

export const APP_VERSION = 'V1.8.7.14';

// Bumped only when the SHAPE of a public/admin JSON response this
// project exposes changes in a way a consumer (Shared Feed, /version,
// /admin/deployment-status) would need to know about — not on every
// feature round. Currently unchanged since it was first introduced.
export const SCHEMA_VERSION = 1;
